            <p>Estimated time: 10 minutes</p>

            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>
              You are invited to participate in a study on portrait relighting, which explores how people perceive changes in lighting within images. This research benefits fields such as telepresence and film, where realistic lighting is essential.
            </p>

            <h4>Procedures</h4>
            <p>The study includes three phases:</p>
            <p>
              <b>Phase 1</b>: Compare images for visual quality, evaluating factors like composition and artifacts.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Phase 2</b>: Compare images for lighting accuracy, focusing on shadows and face lighting.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Phase 3</b>: Compare images for identity preservation, determining how closely the images maintain the personâ€™s appearance.
            </p>
